# Progressive Web Conf

This is a public repo with the ideas about the event called **Progressive Web Conf** (_working title_) dedicated to PWA and the future of the Web Platform which will happen in the end of March 2019 (_approximate date_) in London, UK (_approximate location_). At the moment this is a collection of my *very opinionated* thoughts. They **need** to be validated, discussed and corrected by all the involved parties.

Please, start the reading from the [Motivation](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/3) section, then have a look at [Speakers & content](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/2), then [Type, location, date](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/1), and [Sponsors and pricing](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/4).


Please, review, comment on the ideas exposed in the form of [issues](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues). Also, please [have a look at the current participants](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/blob/master/PARTICIPANTS.md) and join the movement by sending a PR to this file! Please note: this list we have at the moment (May 15th) is purely based on individual "I'm interested" messages received via different channels and does reflect neither planned nor final speaker list.

If you just want to keep yourself updated about the event, [follow my Twitter](https://twitter.com/webmaxru) and/or join the open [PWA slack team](https://bit.ly/go-pwa-slack)

**Despite this is not an announcement of the event but just a draft proposal, we [have a serious issue with the diversity and inclusion](https://github.com/webmaxru/progressive-web-conf/issues/6) - your help is appreciated.**
